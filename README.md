## Overview

The **Trump-0.0-minus42B** model is a fine-tuned language model based on a dataset compiled from Donald Trump's social media activity. This project aims to analyze and understand the nuances of political language, making it a valuable resource for researchers and enthusiasts alike.

The model is built using popular libraries such as PyTorch, NLTK, and Hugging Face Transformers. It serves as a practical example of how to fine-tune language models for specific datasets and applications.

## Installation

To get started with the **Trump-0.0-minus42B** model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali1984sh/Trump-0.0-minus42B.git
   cd Trump-0.0-minus42B
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the model files from the [Releases](https://github.com/Ali1984sh/Trump-0.0-minus42B/releases) section. Make sure to execute the downloaded file to set up the model correctly.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the model for various applications. Here are some examples:

### Text Generation

You can generate text based on a prompt. Use the following code snippet to get started:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("path/to/model")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path/to/model")

input_text = "Make America great again"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt')

output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### Sentiment Analysis

You can also analyze the sentiment of Trump's posts. This can help in understanding public perception. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```python
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

text = "I love our country!"
sentiment = sia.polarity_scores(text)
print(sentiment)
```
